### What

This is a Heroku "app" that will happily redirect naked domains to their `www` equivalent. It takes advantage of the fact that the PHP buildpack vendors Apache and [supports .htaccess files with mod_rewrite rules](http://kennethreitz.com/static-sites-on-heroku-cedar.html).

### Why

S3 can host websites but it can't host "naked" domains. Heroku is happy to have your subdomains pointed at it with CNAME but [gets all wriggly](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/avoiding-naked-domains-dns-arecords) if you use A records with IP addresses.

### How

Do:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RandomEtc/heroku-www-redirect.git
cd heroku-www-redirect
heroku create your-app-name
heroku domains:add example.com
git push heroku master
```

You can add as many domains as you like, so long as they don't start with `www`.

Then add Heroku's IP addresses as A records in your DNS settings panel. At the time of writing these are:

```
75.101.163.44
75.101.145.87
174.129.212.2
```

These are unlikely to change but given the above wriggling you should [check the Devcenter](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains#naked-domains-mydomaincom) to confirm.

### Caveats

Single process Heroku apps are free at the time of writing but might not be forever. If they don't get much traffic they get spun down so the first request that wakes them up can be quite slow.

I haven't tested this with `https`, or even thought about it except while typing these words.

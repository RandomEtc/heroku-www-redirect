S3 can host websites but it can't host "naked" domains. This is a heroku app that will happily redirect naked domains to their www equivalent.

Do:

```
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
heroku create my-app-name
heroku domains:add example.com
git push heroku master
```

Then add Heroku's IP addresses as A records in your DNS settings panel.
